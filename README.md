# K-Means Clustering Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of K-Means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. K-Means clustering is used to partition data into distinct groups based on similarities. In this project, we apply K-Means to a dataset to cluster data points into multiple groups and visualize the results.
## Key Features:
Data preprocessing and feature selection
K-Means clustering algorithm
Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters
Visualization of clusters and centroids
Prediction of new data points based on the trained K-Means model
Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset used for clustering.

images/: Visualizations, such as the elbow plot and cluster visualizations.
Algorithm
## K-Means Clustering:
K-Means clustering partitions the dataset into K distinct clusters. Each cluster is represented by its centroid, and each data point is assigned to the nearest centroid. The algorithm iteratively refines the centroids and cluster assignments to minimize the WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares).

## Elbow Method:
The Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters (K) by evaluating the WCSS for different values of K. The point where the reduction in WCSS slows down significantly is known as the "elbow," and this indicates the best K value.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
